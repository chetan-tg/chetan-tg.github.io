<h3><a id="about"> About Me </a></h3>
<div class="just">
<p>I am a Mechatronics Engineer, currently working as a research associate at <a href = "https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/unit/55685432" target="_blank">KU Leuven Engineering Technology Campus in Brugge</a>, Belgium.</p>

<p>Mechatronics being a multidisciplinary branch of engineering, I have a broad interest in controls engineering, model based system design, structural dynamics, multibody dynamics modeling and simulation. As well their application in hi-tech industry and intelligent mechatronic systems. I am open and eager to learn different domains of engineering and enjoy working in a multidisciplinary team.</p>

<p>I graduated with Master of Science (<i>burgerlijk ingenieur</i>) from the <a href="https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_52354207.htm" target="_blank"> Department of Mechanical Engineering, KU Leuven</a> in February 2018 with the thesis titled "Applying complementary energy methods to estimate ground reaction forces of an exoskeleton" under the supervision of Prof. dr. ir. Joris de Schutter. Before, I earned my undergradate degree [B.E.(Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering] from <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/" target="_blank">BITS Pilani</a>, India. </p>

<p> I have ~4 years of work experience in the industrial automation and automotive industry. In my last position as Test Engineer R&D for dual clutch transmission development at <a href="http://www.punchpowertrain.com" target="_blank"> Punch Powertrain NV</a>, I have gained good understanding of the working of e-dyno test rigs using dSpace ControlDesk and also I have gained good experience working with the hardware, sensing and DAQ systems for development tests. <a href="#contact">Contact</a> me for the detailed curriculum vitae. </p>

    <h3>Master's Thesis</h3>
    <div class="tab">
    <p><b>Applying complementary energy methods to estimate ground reaction forces of an exoskeleton</b></p>
    <p><b>Promoters: </b> Prof. dr. ir. Joris De Schutter & dr. ir. Erwin Aertbelien </p>
    <p>Estimation of the ground contact forces and moments is a major challenge faced in thedevelopment of a model based control algorithm for an exoskeleton. The distribution of thecontact forces is indirectly determined by the compliances in the system. This property is exploitedin this thesis to solve indeterminate contact situations of the exoskeleton. (Distribution of thework: 15% literature, 55% dynamics modelling, simulation and 30% experimental validation.Exoskeleton used in this thesis was developed under <a href="https://www.mirad-sbo.be" target="_blank">MIRAD project</a>.) </p>
