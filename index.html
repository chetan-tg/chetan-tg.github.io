<h3> About Me </h3>
<p>I am a Mechatronics Engineer, currently working as a research associate at <a href = "https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/unit/55685432" target="_blank">KU Leuven Engineering Technology Campus in Brugge</a>, Belgium.</p>

<p>Mechatronics being a multidisciplinary branch of engineering, I have a broad interesting in controls engineering, multibody dynamics modeling and simulation, model based system design and embedded software. As well, I am fascinated by the advacements in the electronics-based technology leading to artificial intelligence. I am open and eager to learn different domains of engineering and enjoy working in a multidisciplinary team.</p>

<p>I graduated with Master of Science (<i>burgerlijk ingenieur</i>) from the <a href="https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_52354207.htm" target="_blank"> Department of Mechanical Engineering, KU Leuven</a> in February 2018 with the thesis titled “Applying complementary energy methods to estimate ground reaction forces of an exoskeleton” under the supervision of Prof. dr. ir. Joris de Schutter. Before, I earned my undergradate degree [B.E.(Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering] from <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/" target="_blank">BITS Pilani</a>, India. </p>

<p> I have ~4 years of work experience in the industrial automation and automotive industry. In my last position as Test Engineer R&D for dual clutch transmission development at <a href="http://www.punchpowertrain.com" target="_blank"> Punch Powertrain NV</a>, I have gained good understanding of the working of e-dyno test rigs using dSpace ControlDesk and also I have gained good experience working with the hardware, sensing and DAQ systems for development tests. </p>
